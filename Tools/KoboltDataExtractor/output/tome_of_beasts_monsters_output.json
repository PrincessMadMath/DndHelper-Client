The original creature regains its natural shadow immediately if the undead shadow is slain.\n\nA creature can only have its shadow stolen by the shadow stealing ray once per day, even if hit by the rays of two different psoglav demons, but it can be knocked back by it every time it is hit.\n\n\n\nProne:\n\n• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.\n\n\n\n• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.\n\n\n\n• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage."

An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.\n\n\n\nLevel — Effect:\n\n1 —Disadvantage on ability checks\n\n2 —Speed halved\n\n3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws\n\n4 —Hit point maximum halved\n\n5 —Speed reduced to 0\n\n6 —Death\n\n\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\n\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\n\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink."

If the gug takes 75 points of damage in a single turn, the swallowed creature is expelled and falls prone next to the gug. When the gug dies, a swallowed creature can crawl from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement.\n\n\n\nBlinded:\n\n• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\n\n\nRestrained:\n\n• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\n\n\n• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws."

Nearby creatures and objects are pushed to the nearest available space and must make a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone. Weapons, armor, and other objects worn or carried by the hulking whelp grow (and shrink again) proportionally when it changes size. Overcome by raw emotion, it sets about destroying anything and everything it can see (which isn’t much) and reach (which is quite a lot). The transformation lasts until the hulking whelp is unaware of any nearby creatures for 1 round, it drops to 0 hit points, it has 5 levels of exhaustion, or it’s affected by a calm emotions spell or comparable magic. The transformation isn’t entirely uncontrollable; people or creatures the whelp knows and trusts can be near it without triggering the reaction.

After creating a hidey-hole, a kikimora can teleport herself and up to 50 lb of objects to the designated location instead of making a normal move. This extradimensional space can only be entered by the kikimora or by a creature using a plane shift spell or ability. The location can be determined by casting detect magic in the area of the sigil, but it takes a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to plane shift into the space.\n\nInside the hidey-hole, a kikimora can see what is going on outside the space through a special sensor. This sensor functions like a window, and it can be blocked by mundane objects placed in front of the sigil. If she leaves an item in her space, it remains there even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. If someone else removes the sigil, all contents are emptied into the Ethereal Plane (including any beings within her hidey-hole at the time). In this case, the kikimora can attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw to instead eject herself (but none of her possessions) into a space adjacent to the sigil."

With thief’s tools and basic construction materials, a trapsmith can set up one of the simple but effective traps listed below in 5 minutes. Triggers involve pressure plates, tripwires, small catches in a lock, or other simple mechanisms.\n\n\n\n• Choke Bomb. This small incendiary device burns rapidly and releases choking smoke in a 20-foot sphere. The area is heavily obscured. Any breathing creature that’s in the affected area when the cloud is created or that starts its turn in the cloud is poisoned. Once a poisoned creature leaves the cloud, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a success. The smoke dissipates after 10 minutes, or after 1 round in a strong wind.\n\n\n\n• Poisoned Sliver. A poisoned sliver or needle can be hidden almost anywhere: inside a lock or a box, in a carpeted floor, on the underside of a door handle, in a cup of liquid or a bowl of gems. When someone meets the conditions for being jabbed by the sliver, the trap makes a melee weapon attack with advantage: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target; Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.\n\n\n\n• Skullpopper. This trap consists of either a heavy weight, a spike, or a blade, set to fall or swing into a victim. When triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack against the first target in its path: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target; Hit: 11 (2d10) damage. The type of damage depends on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a scything blade does slashing damage, etc.\n\n\n\n• Slingsnare. A concealed loop of rope or wire is affixed to a counterweight. When a creature steps into the snare, it must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be yanked into the air and suspended, upside down, 5 feet above the ground. The snared creature is restrained (escape DC 13). The cord is AC 10 and has 5 hit points."

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage at the start of each of the sathaq worm’s turns. The sathaq worm can have only one creature swallowed at a time. If the sathaq worm takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the sathaq worm must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the sathaq worm. If the sathaq worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.\n\n\n\nBlinded:\n\n• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\n\n\nProne:\n\n• A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.\n\n\n\n• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.\n\n\n\n• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.\n\n\n\nLevel — Effect:\n\n1 —Disadvantage on ability checks\n\n2 —Speed halved\n\n3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws\n\n4 —Hit point maximum halved\n\n5 —Speed reduced to 0\n\n6 —Death\n\n\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\n\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\n\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink."

Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.\n\n\n\nLevel — Effect:\n\n1 —Disadvantage on ability checks\n\n2 —Speed halved\n\n3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws\n\n4 —Hit point maximum halved\n\n5 —Speed reduced to 0\n\n6 —Death\n\n\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\n\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\n\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink."

This disease manifests after 24 hours, beginning as a mild chill, but increasingly severe after a day, accompanied by a fever. Hallucinations are common, and the fright they induce lends the disease its name. At onset, the infected creature gains two levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed until the disease is cured by lesser restoration, comparable magic, or rest. The infected creature makes another DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest; a successful save removes one level of exhaustion. If the saving throw fails, the disease persists. If both levels of exhaustion are removed by successful saving throws, the victim has recovered naturally.\n\n\n\nExhaustion:\n\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.\n\n\n\nLevel — Effect:\n\n1 —Disadvantage on ability checks\n\n2 —Speed halved\n\n3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws\n\n4 —Hit point maximum halved\n\n5 —Speed reduced to 0\n\n6 —Death\n\n\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\n\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\n\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink."

A corpse mound can envelop up to 4 creatures at once.\n\n\n\nBlinded:\n\n• A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\n\n\nGrappled:\n\n• A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n\n\n\n• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.\n\n\n\n• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.\n\n\n\nRestrained:\n\n• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\n\n\n• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws."

All sane creatures that start their turns within 60 feet of the fetal savant must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be affected by confusion (as the spell) for 1d4 rounds. This is a psychic effect. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same fetal savant’s babbling for 24 hours. This action cannot be taken when the fetal savant is using Soul Exchange."

                "desc": "As an action, the fetal savant can attempt to take control of a creature it can see within 90 feet, forcing an exchange of souls as a magic jar spell, using its own body as the container. The fetal savant can use this power at will, but it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time. The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same fetal savant’s soul exchange for 24 hours. If the saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target’s body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing with otherworldly light.\n\nAs an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim’s soul to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0 hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying; it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in the fetal savant’s withered body, the victim is effectively paralyzed and helpless.\n\n\n\nParalyzed:\n\n• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.\n\n\n\n• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\n\n\n• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature."
