While attuned to and wearing the ring, Artus can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:\n\n\n\n• Artus can expend 1 charge and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point he can see within 300 feet of him. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of _30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless Artus uses the ring to end the effect as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.\n\n\n\n• Artus can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).\n\n\n\n• Artus can expend the necessary number of charges and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (Artus's choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Artus. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary."

After 10 minutes, the terrain in the area reshapes to assume the appearance of a location sought by one intelligent creature whose mind the balhannoth has read (see Regional Effects below). The transformation affects nonliving material only and can't create anything with moving parts or magical properties. Any object created in this area is, upon close inspection, revealed as a fake. Books are filled with empty pages, golden items are obvious counterfeits, and so on. The transformation lasts until the balhannoth dies or uses this lair action again.\n\n\n\n• The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the target, along with whatever it is wearing and carrying, teleports to an unoccupied space of the balhannoth's choice within 60 feet of it.\n\n\n\n• The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the balhannoth becomes invisible to that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the balhannoth attacks the target.\n\n\n\nInvisible:\n\n• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage."

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n4. Slowing Ray.

The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.\n\n7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.\n\n8. Petrification Ray.

On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\n\n9. Disintegration Ray.

If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.\n\nIf the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw.

For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.\n\nA clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.\n\n\n\nd10 — Enhancement:\n\n\n\n1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.\n\n\n\n2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.\n\n\n\n3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.\n\n\n\n4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.\n\n\n\n6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.\n\n\n\n7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.\n\n\n\n8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\n9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).\n\n\n\n10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\nClockwork Malfunctions:\n\n\n\nd10 — Malfunction\n\n\n\n1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\n\n\n4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.\n\n\n\n5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.\n\n\n\n6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.\n\n\n\n7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.\n\n\n\n8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine."

Nothing of the digested body remains.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n\nWishes.\n\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

                "desc": "The death tyrant shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 ft. of it:\n\n1. Charm Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the death tyrant for 1 hour, or until the death tyrant harms the creature.\n\n2. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n3. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n4. Slowing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n5. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n6. Telekinetic Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up to 30 ft. in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip until the start of the death tyrant's next turn or until the death tyrant is incapacitated.\n\nIf the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 ft. in any direction. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.\n\n7. Sleep Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.\n\n8. Petrification Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.\n\n9. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.\n\nIf the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.\n\n10. Death Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.\n\n\n\nCharmed:\n\n• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\n\n\n\n• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\n\n\nFrightened:\n\n• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\n\n\n\n• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\n\n\nParalyzed:\n\n• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.\n\n\n\n• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\n\n\n• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\n\n\n\nPetrified:\n\n• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.\n\n\n\n• The creature is incapacitated (meaning it can't take actions or reactions), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\n\n\n• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\n• The creature has resistance to all damage.\n\n\n\n• The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.\n\n\n\nRestrained:\n\n• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\n\n\n• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\nUnconscious:\n\n• An unconscious creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.\n\n\n\n• The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.\n\n\n\n• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\n\n\n• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature."

Hypnotic Gaze: The target is charmed by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this gaze requires Demogorgon to focus both heads on the target, he can't use his Maddening Gaze legendary action until the start of his next turn.\n\n3. Insanity Gaze: The target suffers the effect of the confusion spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.\n\n\n\nCharmed:\n\n• A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\n\n\n\n• The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\n\n\n\nStunned:\n\n• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.\n\n\n\n• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage."

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n\nWishes.\n\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.\n\n\n\nDisguises.\n\nSome genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n\nWishes.\n\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

If it wins the contest, the intellect devourer magically consumes the target's brain, teleports into the target's skull, and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the intellect devourer has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The intellect devourer retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Deep Speech, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including spells and languages.\n\nIf the host body dies, the intellect devourer must leave it. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the body drives the intellect devourer out. The intellect devourer is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a wish. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the intellect devourer can voluntarily leave the body, teleporting to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The body then dies, unless its brain is restored within 1 round."

For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.\n\nA clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.\n\n\n\nd10 — Enhancement:\n\n\n\n1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.\n\n\n\n2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.\n\n\n\n3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.\n\n\n\n4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.\n\n\n\n6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.\n\n\n\n7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.\n\n\n\n8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\n9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).\n\n\n\n10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\nClockwork Malfunctions:\n\n\n\nd10 — Malfunction\n\n\n\n1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\n\n\n4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.\n\n\n\n5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.\n\n\n\n6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.\n\n\n\n7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.\n\n\n\n8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine."

If it's holding no weapon, it makes an unarmed strike. If no creature is visible within 30 feet, it takes the Dash action, moving toward the nearest creature.\n\n\n\n3.

The kobold hurls a flask of acid. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage.\n\n\n\n2. Alchemist’s fire. The kobold throws a flask of alchemist's fire. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target’s turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.\n\n\n\n3. Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a S-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm’s turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.\n\n\n\n4. Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined S-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.\n\n\n\n5. Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.\n\n\n\n6. Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n\n\n7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can’t take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn’t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.\n\n\n\n8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there’s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses."

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.\n\nWishes.\n\nThe genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.\n\nTo be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit."

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n\n\n2.

On a failed save, the target’s speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the creature can’t take reactions, and it can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n\n\n5. Stunning Ray: The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n\n\n6. Telekinetic Ray: If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the mindwitness moves it up to 30 feet in any direction, and it is restrained by the ray’s telekinetic grip until the start of the mindwitness’s next turn or until the mindwitness is incapacitated.\n\nIf the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is telekinetically moved up to 30 feet in any direction. The mindwitness can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a container.\n\n\n\nFrightened:\n\n• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\n\n\n\n• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\n\n\nIncapacitated:\n\n• An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.\n\n\n\nRestrained:\n\n• A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.\n\n\n\n• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\nStunned:\n\n• A stunned creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.\n\n\n\n• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage."

You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.\n\n\n\nd10 — Enhancement:\n\n\n\n1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.\n\n\n\n2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.\n\n\n\n3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.\n\n\n\n4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.\n\n\n\n6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.\n\n\n\n7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.\n\n\n\n8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\n9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).\n\n\n\n10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\nClockwork Malfunctions:\n\n\n\nd10 — Malfunction\n\n\n\n1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\n\n\n4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.\n\n\n\n5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.\n\n\n\n6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.\n\n\n\n7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.\n\n\n\n8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine."

An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.\n\n\n\nLevel — Effect:\n\n1 —Disadvantage on ability checks\n\n2 —Speed halved\n\n3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws\n\n4 —Hit point maximum halved\n\n5 —Speed reduced to 0\n\n6 —Death\n\n\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\n\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\n\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink."

Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host's chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.\n\nIf the disease is cured before the tadpole's emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated."

The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.\n\nA hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over."

On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is poisoned, which causes it to also gain 1 level of exhaustion. While poisoned in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of exhaustion caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to suffer another level of exhaustion. Once the target reaches 6 levels of exhaustion, it dies and instantly transforms into a living abyssal wretch under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.\n\n\n\nExhaustion:\n\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.\n\n\n\nLevel — Effect:\n\n1 —Disadvantage on ability checks\n\n2 —Speed halved\n\n3 —Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws\n\n4 —Hit point maximum halved\n\n5 —Speed reduced to 0\n\n6 —Death\n\n\n\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.\n\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\n\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\n\n\n\nPoisoned:\n\n• A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks."

If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.\n\nA creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.\n\n\n\nd100 — Effect:\n\n\n\n01–05 — The color of the target's hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned.\n\n\n\n06–10 — The target's eyes push out of its head at the end of stalks.\n\n\n\n11–15 — The target's hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers.\n\n\n\n16–20 — One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n21–25 — The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open.\n\n\n\n26–30 — A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\n31–35 — The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is deafened.\n\n\n\n36–40 — Two of the target's teeth turn into tusks.\n\n\n\n41–45 — The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1).\n\n\n\n46–50 — The target's arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls.\n\n\n\n51–55 — The target's arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet.\n\n\n\n56–60 — The target's legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n61–65 — The target grows a whiplike tail, which it can use as a whip.\n\n\n\n66–70 — The target's eyes turn black, and it gains darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\n\n\n71–75 — The target swells, tripling its weight.\n\n\n\n76–80 — The target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight.\n\n\n\n81–85 — The target's head doubles in size.\n\n\n\n86–90 — The target's ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet.\n\n\n\n91–95 — The target's body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n\n\n96–00 — The target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or stunned.\n\n\n\nDeafened:\n\n• A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing."

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n3. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\n\n\nFrightened:\n\n• A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\n\n\n\n• The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\n\n\n\nParalyzed:\n\n• A paralyzed creature is incapacitated, meaning it can't take actions or reactions, and can't move or speak.\n\n\n\n• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\n\n\n\n• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.\n\n\n\n• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature."

For that reason, even clockworks that fit established designs, such as those described here, are seldom identical.\n\nA clockwork can be customized by adding one of the following enhancements and one potential malfunction to its stat block. You can select randomly or choose a pair of modifications that fit the temperament of the clockwork's builder.\n\n\n\nd10 — Enhancement:\n\n\n\n1 — Camouflaged. The clockwork gains proficiency in Stealth if it doesn't already have it. While motionless, it is indistinguishable from a stopped machine.\n\n\n\n2 — Sensors. The range of the clockwork's darkvision becomes 120 feet, unless it is higher, and it gains proficiency in Perception if it doesn't already have it.\n\n\n\n3 — Improved Armor. The clockwork's AC increases by 2.\n\n\n\n4 — Increased Speed. The clockwork's speed increases by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n5 — Reinforced Construction. The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.\n\n\n\n6 — Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.\n\n\n\n7 — Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.\n\n\n\n8 — Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\n9 — Vocal Resonator. The clockwork gains the ability to speak rudimentary Common or Gnomish (creator's choice).\n\n\n\n10 — Water Propulsion. The clockwork gains a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\n\n\nClockwork Malfunctions:\n\n\n\nd10 — Malfunction\n\n\n\n1 — Faulty Sensors. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is blinded until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n2 — Flawed Targeting. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork makes attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n3 — Ground Fault. The clockwork has vulnerability to lightning damage.\n\n\n\n4 — Imprinting Loop. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork mistakes one creature it can see within 30 feet for its creator. The clockwork won't willingly harm that creature for 1 minute or until that creature attacks it or deals damage to it.\n\n\n\n5 — Leaking Lubricant. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork gains 1 level of exhaustion that it isn't immune to.\n\n\n\n6 — Limited Steering. The clockwork must move in a straight line. It can turn up to 90 degrees before moving and again at the midpoint of its movement. It can rotate freely if it doesn't use any of its speeds on its turn.\n\n\n\n7 — Overactive Sense of Self-Preservation. If the clockwork has half its hit points or fewer at the start of its turn in combat, roll a d6. If you roll a 1, it retreats from combat. If retreat isn't possible, it continues fighting.\n\n\n\n8 — Overheats. Roll a d6 at the start of the clockwork's turn. If you roll a 1, the clockwork is incapacitated until the end of its turn.\n\n\n\n9 — Rusty Gears. The clockwork has disadvantage on initiative rolls, and its speed decreases by 10 feet.\n\n\n\n10 — Weak Armor. The clockwork isn't immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine."

Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these rot grubs. After this time, these rot grubs are too far under the skin to be burned. If a target infested by rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the rot grubs burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all rot grubs infesting the target."

Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or the creature's concentration is broken.\n\nThe shock wave deals 100 thunder damage to all structures in contact with the ground in the area. If a creature is near a structure that collapses, the creature might be buried; a creature within half the distance of the structure's height must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is trapped in the rubble. A trapped creature is restrained, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. Another creature within 5 feet of the buried creature can use its action to clear rubble and grant advantage on the check.

On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the \"Myconids\" entry in the Monster Manual)."
